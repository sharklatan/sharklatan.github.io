								We here at JonaIPhone would like to extend a special thanks to all of our users. Without you guys, we wouldn't be nearly what we are today. This new app is our way of saying thank you (or at least trying to) for being such dedicated users and fans. We hope you enjoy using the new app; we know we sure love it! A lot of hard work has gone into this application and into our application library so that you guys have plenty of fresh content, and none of that would be possible without any of you.
